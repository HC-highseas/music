### Declaration  

This project is primarily the result of my own efforts, including the core development, functionality, and design. However, for enhancing the user interface and making it more responsive, I have leveraged AI tools and suggestions. While I could have achieved similar results independently, AI assistance allowed me to refine and expedite certain aspects of the GUI. The majority of the project's code, logic, and design remain original and self-developed.  

## [Update] Repository Restored
